Tikal Share (Android)
===================

Tikal Share is an android (can be expanded to other platforms) application which
presents the user with an interactive and responsive view of Tikal YouTube channel content.

The responsive designed video summary view presents pages of each playlist on the 
Tikal YouTube channel.  Clicking on a video opens the YouTube Player view which
uses the YouTube Android API.

Also using Google Backend Starter the option is added to the application to apply
a user name to the application which will sync the 'watched until' place in each
video among other Android devices with the same user applied.
